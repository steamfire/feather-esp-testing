The Adafruit Feather ESP32-s2 board definition seems to leave out the PIN_I2C_POWER definition, so here is manually adding it

#define PIN_I2C_POWER 7


For any sketch that needs to use I2c, this code turns on the I2C bus:

// turn on the I2C power by setting pin to opposite of 'rest state'
  pinMode(PIN_I2C_POWER, INPUT);
  delay(1);
  bool polarity = digitalRead(PIN_I2C_POWER);
  pinMode(PIN_I2C_POWER, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(PIN_I2C_POWER, !polarity);
